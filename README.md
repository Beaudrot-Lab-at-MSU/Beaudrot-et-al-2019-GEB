This repo contains everything necessary to recreate the results and figures for:  

Beaudrot, L., M. Acevedo, J.P. Lessard, A. Zvoleff, P.A. Jansen, C. Fletcher, E. Larney, T. Oâ€™Brien, F. Rovero, D. Sheil, S. Andelman and J. Ahumada. (2019). Local temperature and ecological similarity drive distributional dynamics of tropical mammals worldwide. Global Ecology and Biogeography. 28(7):976-991. 

Formatted data and the main analysis file (Unmarked_Colext_Analysis_Simple.R) are in the folder "Occupancy Modelling". The file "BIOTIC_Include.RData" is the ecological similarity covariate data, which was calculated using the files in the folder "FPDist Calculation"

The folder "Results" has the output of colext model selection. There are two summary results files that have the best model and null model results for each population. There is an additional folder containing all model results for each individual population.

Code to produce figures 2-5 is in the folder "Figures"
